## About this Project
Uber simulation app using:   
-Firestore Database.   
-Firebase Auth.   
-geolocation with Geolocator and Geocoding libs.   
-StreamSubscription listener.   
-StreamBuilder.

## Functionalities   
-registered user authentication.   
-real-time location on both devices.   
-service value calculation. 

## Difficulties
-the base project course was made with Flutter 2.0 < , so I had to refactor almost the entirety including adding Nullsafety.   
-this project was made based on the course [Desenvolvimento Android e IOS com Flutter](https://www.udemy.com/course/desenvolvimento-android-e-ios-com-flutter/), from
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=0EOJOrTo2D4&ranSiteID=0EOJOrTo2D4-jEdslSFjh_Izd2eciLplfw&LSNPUBID=0EOJOrTo2D4&utm_source=aff-campaign&utm_medium=udemyads), but due to the frequent updates of Flutter many functionalities and syntax have changed, so I fixed it by searching one by one.   
This challenge sure made me improve my skills! lol    
In the end it was pretty cool!
## Made in
-Flutter 3.0.1 ‚Ä¢ channel stable.   
-Dart SDK version: 2.17.1 (stable).
